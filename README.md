## 🧠 How It Works

### 🙂 Face and Eye Detection
Uses **dlib’s 68 facial landmark predictor** to detect facial features and accurately locate eye regions in real time.

### 👁️ Gaze Estimation
Eye gaze direction is determined by comparing **white pixel distribution** between the left and right halves of the eye region.  
This allows classification into **left**, **centre**, or **right** gaze.

### 👁️‍🗨️ Blink Detection
Blinking is detected using **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)**.  
A sustained blink is used as a **confirmation signal** to select characters.

### ⌨️ Virtual Keyboard Logic
The keyboard **automatically cycles through keys**.  
The currently active key is highlighted, and a blink selects it.
